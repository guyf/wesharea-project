We will never knowingly give your personal information to anyone else, even that which facebook already makes public. We might, in the future, use completely anonymous data about what our users are sharing to provide special offers or target unobtrusive adverts.
 
If you provide an email address we will only use it for alerts you specifically request or to keep you informed of offers and tools we believe will be of interest or benefit to you. We will never send more than one email per month and only if you subscribe.
